            <p class="kopano">Best-first search is an AI search algorithm that attempts to find the most promising 
			path from a given starting point to a goal. The algorithm works by evaluating the cost of each possible
			path using a heuristic function. The path with the lowest cost is expanded first, and this process is
			repeated until the goal is reached. Best-first search is also known as greedy search, as it does not 
			consider the cost of the path to the current state.</p>
